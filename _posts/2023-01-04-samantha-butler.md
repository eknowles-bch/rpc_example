# Cardiac Neurodevelopmental Program 

## Mentor Name:

Samantha Butler PhD (samantha.butler@childrens.harvard.edu) and Anjali Sadhwani PhD (anjali.sadhwani@childrens.harvard.edu)

## Research Theme(s): 

Anxiety, Risk Identification, Developmental Psychopathology, and EEG.

## Brief Description of the Project: 

The Cardiac Neurodevelopmental Program has a variety of research and quality improvement projects investigating the development of children with CHD and their families. We have a new Children’s Heart Foundation funded research study on developmental care in the NIDCAP model on the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and Acute Care Cardiology Unit (ACCU) (Samantha Butler, PhD, PI).  There are ongoing quality improvement studies on the inpatient floors to support developmental care, parent engagement, infant oral feeding, and holding of fragile infants, many of which take place through the Simulation Program here at BCH.  We are also looking at the predictive validity of our neuropsychological assessments for children with CHD and creating developmental of growth charts for toddlers with CHD, funded through the Cardiac Neurodevelopmental Outcome Collaborative (Anjali Sadhwani, PhD, PI). We have an NIH-funded research study looking at fetal brain development and long-term neuropsychological outcomes in CHD (Caitlin Rollins, M.D., PI) and the longitudinal neuropsychological follow-up of adults enrolled as children in the Boston Circulatory Arrest Study (David Bellinger, PhD and Jane Newburger, Co-PIs). Other recent CNP research efforts address the development and implementation of a prenatal stress reduction program, group-based executive function interventions, studies of the comorbidity between autism and CHD, and following children with single ventricle heart disease over time.
